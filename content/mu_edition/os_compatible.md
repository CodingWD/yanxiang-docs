## Official Support

We prioritize support for the following operating systems.

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## Compatible List

We've tested the basic functions of various operating systems on Innuo Mu and compiled a compatibility table.

The table will be continuously updated with new BIOS and bug fixes.

!!! Note "Mark Pattern"

    - 🟢 Green indicates that the OS can be installed normally. Basic interfaces such as USB, HDMI, PCIe, and SATA can be identified and used without any additional steps.
    - 🔴 Red indicates that the OS cannot be installed completely, either due to some issues.

If you discover that an operating system has undergone a significant update and needs to be retested, or if you wish for us to test additional operating systems, you may create a new issue in [Innuo Mu repository](https://github.com/InnuoTeam/Innuo-Mu/issues), or you can email us at [techsupport@Innuo.com](mailto:techsupport@Innuo.com).
